    navigate needs to be wrapped in an arrow function before being passed
    to onClick because it has a custom parameter. onClick only passes an
    event, so it won't know how to supply other parameters. But you can't
    add parentheses to navigate because that would call it rather than
    passing it as a variable. Arrow functions allow navigate to have
    parentheses because they wrap it in a variable, so the function call
    doesn't happen until the variable is called as a function.
